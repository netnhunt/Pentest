STEPS

1) Perform recon using OSINT (eg: Harvester, Recon-Ng, SpiderFoot, Creepy)
2) Use email obtained from recon to perform Phishing (eg: Gophish)
3) Compromise at-least one system in the target domain (elevated priviledge not required)
4) Use the compromised system and user account to query the domain and discover the doamin 
   assests/accounts/policies (see tools list below for details)
5) Look for trust relations in the GPO to exploit other systems (explore inherent/chain trusts)
6) Kerberoasting (https://hausec.com/2019/03/12/penetration-testing-active-directory-part-ii/)
    - GetUserSPNs.py
    - Rubeus
    - SILENTTRINITY
7) Priviledge Escalation (missing patch/Misconfigured Services/unquoted service paths)

    - Also look at MS14-025 GPP (group policy preferences) escalation vulnerability
